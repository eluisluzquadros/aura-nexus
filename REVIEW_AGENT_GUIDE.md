## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
import pandas as pd
from src.agents.review_agent import ComprehensiveReviewAgent

async def basic_review():
    # Load your processed data
    df = pd.read_excel('processed_results.xlsx')
    
    # Initialize review agent
    review_agent = ComprehensiveReviewAgent()
    
    # Run comprehensive review
    results = await review_agent.comprehensive_review(
        results_df=df,
        output_dir="review_reports"
    )
    
    # Get quality score
    quality_score = results['summary']['overall_assessment']['quality_score']
    print(f"Quality Score: {quality_score:.2f}/100")
    
    # Check for fake data
    if results['summary']['key_findings']['fake_data_detected']:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Fake data detected in results!")
    
    return results

# Run the review
results = asyncio.run(basic_review())
```

### Advanced Usage with Integration

```python
from src.agents.review_agent import ComprehensiveReviewAgent, run_comprehensive_review

# Quick review of existing file
results = await run_comprehensive_review(
    df_path="data/output/processed_leads.xlsx",
    output_dir="reports",
    original_df_path="data/input/original_leads.xlsx"  # For comparison
)

# Access specific components
quality_metrics = results['review_report']['quality_analysis']['metrics']
improvement_plan = results['improvement_plan']
learning_insights = results['learning_results']
```

### Integration with Lead Processor

```python
from integration_example import EnhancedLeadProcessor

async def process_with_quality_review():
    processor = EnhancedLeadProcessor()
    await processor.initialize()
    
    results = await processor.process_leads_with_quality_review(
        input_file="leads.xlsx",
        features=['scoring', 'contact_extraction', 'social_scraping'],
        enable_auto_review=True
    )
    
    return results
```

## Detection Capabilities

### Fake Phone Number Patterns
- **All same digits**: 11111111111, 22222222222, etc.
- **Sequential patterns**: 123456789, 987654321
- **Invalid patterns**: 000000000, 999999999
- **Length validation**: Too short (<10) or too long (>15)
- **Format validation**: Proper phone number structure

### Fake Email Patterns  
- **Test domains**: test@test.com, example@example.com
- **Fake domains**: fake@fake.com, dummy@dummy.com
- **Invalid formats**: Missing @, invalid TLD
- **Blacklisted domains**: Configurable domain blacklist

### Fake Business Names
- **Test patterns**: "test company", "test empresa"
- **Fake keywords**: "fake", "dummy", "example"
- **Invalid formats**: Only numbers, single characters
- **Length validation**: Too short business names

## Quality Metrics Explained

### Overall Score (0-100)
Calculated based on:
- Data completeness (30% weight)
- Data accuracy (25% weight) 
- Fake data percentage (20% weight)
- Consistency issues (15% weight)
- Enrichment success (10% weight)

### Issue Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Data corruption, missing required fields, high fake data
- **High**: Format errors, validation failures, significant inconsistencies
- **Medium**: Completeness issues, minor inconsistencies
- **Low**: Style/format suggestions, optimization opportunities

## Configuration Options

### Quality Thresholds
```python
quality_thresholds = {
    'minimum_overall_score': 70,
    'minimum_completeness_score': 80,
    'maximum_fake_data_percentage': 5,
    'minimum_enrichment_score': 60
}
```

### Validation Rules
```python
validation_rules = {
    'enable_phone_validation': True,
    'enable_email_validation': True,
    'enable_business_name_validation': True,
    'fake_data_detection_threshold': 0.8
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Quality Reviews
- Run reviews after each batch processing
- Monitor quality trends over time
- Set up automated alerts for quality degradation

### 2. Fake Data Prevention
- Implement validation at data input stage
- Regular review of data sources
- Training for data collection processes

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Act on improvement recommendations
- Track implementation success
- Update validation rules based on learnings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
```bash
pip install pandas numpy validators phonenumbers
```

**Unicode Errors**: Use ASCII-only output in Windows environments

**Memory Issues**: Process large datasets in batches
```python
# Process in chunks for large datasets
chunk_size = 1000
for chunk in pd.read_excel('large_file.xlsx', chunksize=chunk_size):
    results = await review_agent.comprehensive_review(chunk)
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use caching for repeated validations
- Process in parallel for large datasets
- Enable/disable specific validation types as needed
